Problems:
1. Block size is/was confusing. bang for the buck (more accurate size)
2. relative path looks nice, but not as convenient for the manual process afterwards
3. lacks color for dir and files
4. takes a long time (it is harder to read from drive than the memory)
5. their own language and locale(numbers, dates, times)


Solution:
1. drop block size
2. print absolute path
3. add colors
4.
    a. add animation
    b. look into some inefficiencies, such as extra recursion
    c. fundamentally thats the cost of doing business
5. i18n i10n
