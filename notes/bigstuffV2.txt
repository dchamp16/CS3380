Problems:
1. Block size is/was confusing. bang for the buck (more accurate size) good
2. relative path looks nice, but not as convenient for the manual process afterwards
3. lacks color for dir and files
4. takes a long time (it is harder to read from drive than the memory)
5. their own language and locale(numbers, dates, times)
    a. how does the user pick the lang and loc
6. nicer to have regEx filtering or globbing
7. no error messages
8. doesnt work at the drive root


Solution:
1. drop block size (10min)
2. print absolute path (10min)
3. add colors, use chalk.js (30min)
4.
    a. add animation (30min)
    b. look into some inefficiencies, such as extra recursion (1-2hrs)
    c. fundamentally thats the cost of doing business
5. write in i18n i10n 
    a. lang and loc command line argos (1hr)
    b. environment variables 
    c. default
    d. command line arg to a config file
6. pick regEx filter (builtin) xor globing glob.js (1-2hrs)
7. put in error handling (msg to user and print help) (1hr)
8. more error handling (silently swallow the error and move on)
